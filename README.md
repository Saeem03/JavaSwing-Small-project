# JavaSwing-Small-project
 
In our Address Book application, we have a Person class java file and 4 JavaSwing GUI frame java files.
we have a Menu on the landing page. In the menu, we have 4 options- Add, Show All Contacts, Search and Edit.
In Add, we have text fields and a button to add a new contact in the address book. Using the text fields, we take inputs of Person name, phone no, email and address. Add button appends the personal information in a text file named “Info.txt”.
In Show All Contacts, we have a text area that shows all the information stored in the “Info.txt” file. We used the Scanner object to read the information from the file and showed output in the textfield.
In Search, we have a text field that takes the input of a Person name(String) as input and 
the search button reads information from the “Info.txt” file and shows the specific Person’s information in the text area.
In Edit, we have a search that searches the person information from the file “info.txt”.
If a search name founds, a panel is set visible to the user which contains the text fields of the personal information. We can edit the information in the text fields and click the edit button for edit operation.
